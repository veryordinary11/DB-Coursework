# DB Coursework

In the **Code** folder, you can find three files named `create.sql`, `insert.sql`, and `query.sql`.

There is also a **documentation** file and a **draw.io** diagram that explain the logic of this system.

Additionally, I have created some sample data and inserted it into the tables.
